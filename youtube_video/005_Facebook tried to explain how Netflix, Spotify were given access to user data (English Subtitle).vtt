LIZ: FACEBOOK'S LATEST DEFENSE

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.548
AFTER THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.584
BOMBSHELL PIECE SHOWING THEY

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:20.054
SHARED YOUR INFORMATION WITH BIG

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:23.657
TECH COMPANIES WITHOUT YOUR

00:00:23.658 --> 00:00:25.159
PERMISSION.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.461
MEDIA REPORTER JOE CONCHA.

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.897
FACEBOOK IS SAYING, "NEW YORK

00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:31.331
TIMES," YOU GOT IT WRONG.

00:00:31.332 --> 00:00:34.635
THEY ARE SAYING WHEN NETFLIX AND

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:37.971
SPOTIFY, IF YOU ARE ON NETFLIX

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:40.274
AND SPOTIFY, AND YOU WANT TO SAY

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:42.509
I LIKE THIS MOVIE OR SONG AND

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.546
YOU MESSAGE IT VIA FACEBOOK

00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:47.114
THAT'S WHY THEY SEE THE

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:47.781
MESSAGING.

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:49.683
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEIR

00:00:49.684 --> 00:00:50.350
EXPLANATION THERE?

00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:53.620
&gt;&gt; THEY APPEAR TO BE SAYING THIS

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:55.656
IS VOLUNTARY BY THEIR USERS.

00:00:55.657 --> 00:00:59.126
A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE WON'T

00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:00.461
TRUST FACEBOOK BECAUSE SO MUCH

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:02.229
OTHER INFORMATION HAS BEEN

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.230
EXPOSED.

00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.965
PERSONAL INFORMATION IN MANY

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.066
CASES.

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:08.268
THIS HAS BEEN A HORRIBLE YEAR

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:09.236
FOR FACEBOOK.

00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:13.273
THEIR MARKET VALUE IS DOWN $215

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:13.741
BILLION.

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:16.810
SO THEN YOU KIND OF DRAW BACK TO

00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:18.145
PERHAPS WILL THIS BE THE SAME

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:20.414
SITUATION WE SAW WITH STEVE JOBS

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:21.381
WITH APPLE?

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:23.317
I DON'T KNOW IF A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:25.119
SAW THE MOVIES OR READ THE

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.186
BOOKS.

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:28.822
BUT STEVE JOBS WAS REMOVED AS

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:31.759
THE FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.861
THE COMPANY CREATED IN HIS

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:34.495
GARAGE.

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:37.164
HIS OWN CEO GOT THE BOARD TO

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:39.133
VOTE HIM OUT.

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:41.135
HE EVENTUALLY CAME BACK AND

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:42.236
SAVED THE COMPANY.

00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:46.373
IT TURNS OUT MARK ZUCKERBERG HAS

00:01:46.374 --> 00:01:48.876
60% OF THE VOTING POWER BECAUSE

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:51.745
OF A DUAL CLASS STRUCTURE THAT

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:54.081
WEIGHS CERTAIN SHARES OVER

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:54.414
OTHERS.

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:56.984
FOR HOME WHO THINK ZUCKERBERG

00:01:56.985 --> 00:01:59.119
CAN GET KICKED OUT, PROBABLY

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.386
NOT.

00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:04.892
LIZ: REMEMBER MARK ZUCKERBERG

00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:09.530
SAID, JANUARY, I'M GOING TO FIX

00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:10.531
FACEBOOK.

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:11.965
EXECUTIVES QUITTING OR BEING

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.066
FORCED OUT.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:16.136
AND THIS APOLOGY TOUR BY

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:17.604
ZUCKERBERG AND SANDBERG THAT

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.239
THEY ARE GOING TO DO BETTER.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.208
WHERE DOES IT END?

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.710
EVEN IF YOU BREAK UP FACEBOOK,

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:26.146
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE FLOCKING TO

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:26.513
FACEBOOK.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:28.148
I AM NOT SURE HOW IT END.

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:29.817
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE EITHER.

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:32.352
IN MY CASE I'M NOT ALLOWED TO

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:34.288
LEAVE.

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:35.923
MY RELATIVES WOULD KILL ME.

00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:38.325
WHERE ARE THE PICTURES OF THE

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:38.859
KID.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.128
SO IT KILLS A LOT OF BIRD WITH

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.329
ONE STONE.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.865
BUT MARK ZUCKERBERG WHEN HE

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:47.901
CREATED THIS COMPANY -- WHEN HE

00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:50.103
STOLE THE IDEA FOR THIS COMPANY

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:53.674
SOME WOULD SAY BACK IN HARVARD

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:57.444
IN 2003 IN A ROOM WEB WAS JUST

00:02:57.445 --> 00:02:58.846
AN IDEAS GUY.

00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:01.448
I CAN GIVE EVERYONE A FACEBOOK

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:05.219
WAY TO SHARE THEIR HISTORY AND

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.586
THOUGHTS.

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:09.323
HE NEVER WAS A BUSINESSMAN.

00:03:09.324 --> 00:03:13.160
LIZ: PEOPLE AREN'T BUYING THIS

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.061
ALTRUISTIC KIND OF TALK.

00:03:14.062 --> 00:03:17.297
WHEN YOU WALK BY A STORE AND ALL

00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:20.200
OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE ON YOUR

00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.969
FACEBOOK AN AD POP UP.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.271
IT'S ABOUT YOUR LOCATION.

00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:26.673
THAT'S CREEPY.

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:29.109
THEY CAN FIND YOUR LOCATION VIA

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.045
YOUR INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS.

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:35.415
WOULD YOU PAY FACEBOOK $5 A

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:38.385
MONTH AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:41.555
I WHAT AN AD-FREE PRIVATE

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:42.089
EXPERIENCE.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.125
I WANT MY INFORMATION LOCKED

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:46.093
DOWN.

00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:47.928
WOULD I PAY THEM MONTHLY?

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.031
&gt;&gt; IF I COULD TRUST THEY WOULD

00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:53.367
KEEP MY INFORMATION LOCKED DOWN?

00:03:53.368 --> 00:03:54.368
$60 A YEAR?

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.902
MAYBE.

00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:56.303
I THINK BECAUSE THE RELEVANCE

00:03:56.304 --> 00:04:00.540
AND THE PRESSURE THEM WOULD BE

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:01.508
OVERWHELMING.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.277
THE LOCATION SERVICES YOU ARE

00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:03.744
TALKING ABOUT.

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:05.579
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THEM ON EVERY

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.682
TIME YOU PUT A PICTURE UP THEY

00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:11.218
WHAT TO SAY WHERE YOU ARE.

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.785
$5.

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:13.654
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WALK

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:14.888
AWAY FROM IT.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.090
THE MINUTE YOU PUT A PRICE TAG

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:18.425
ON IT.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.294
SUDDENLY THEY DON'T LOVE IT AS

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:21.695
MUCH.

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:25.333
SOME COMPETITOR COMES ALONG AND
