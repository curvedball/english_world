00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:08.480
40 Years ago China 
opened up its economy to the rest of the world.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.280
A move, that ultimately turned China into
a global economic powerhouse, second in GDP

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.049
only to the US.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.460
In his speech at the Great Hall of the People
in the Chinese capital Beijing Chinese President

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.560
Xi Jinping vowed to press ahead with economic
reforms.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.820
But he also made clear that Beijing will not
deviate from its one-party system or take

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.320
orders from any other country.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:53.239
His comments come as the United States demands
more transparency in trade relations

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:37.820
with Bejing.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.380
China's economy has grown faster than that
of any other major country.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.390
Once poor and underdeveloped, the Asian giant
has now grown into one of the most important

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.800
export markets for manufacturers from all
over the world -- a true heavyweight in international

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.260
trade.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.320
The architect who laid the foundation stones
for its economic miracle: Deng Xiaoping.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.310
He became the country's leader in December
of 1978, and subsequently left a lasting mark

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.840
on the communist country's economy.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.570
Under him, private companies were allowed
into China, along with foreign investment.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.760
Deng also created special economic zones.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.620
In the four decades since, China has changed
in dramatic ways.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.380
Millions of rural workers have streamed into
the country's megacities.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.960
The gap between rich and poor has grown...along
with overall prosperity.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.550
Many more people there now earn enough money
to spend on more than just simple survival.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:46.421
I hope that China will continue to insist
on opening-up because clearly the opening

00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:52.020
that we have seen in the last 40 years has
been very beneficial for the Chinese people

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.030
and for the Chinese economy.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.640
But hopes that a market economy would usher
in more democracy and freedom have remained

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.950
largely illusory.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.161
Foreign companies complain that the state
still has too much influence over trade, or

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:08.570
that its oversight is even on the rise.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.410
And the country has also paid a high price
for the last 40 years of rapid growth....it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:04:11.780
was purchased in many parts

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:56.029
of

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:28.689
the country

00:05:28.689 --> 00:06:07.029
at the cost of the environment.
