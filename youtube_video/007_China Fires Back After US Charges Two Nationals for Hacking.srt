1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,919
we begin this hour with the latest tit

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,440
for tat between the US and China one day

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,359
after the United States accused two

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:07,980
Chinese citizens of carrying out an

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,380
extensive hacking campaign to steal data

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,718
from American companies China is now

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,900
firing back defending itself huge and

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,600
floatin a million the Chinese government

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,939
has never participated or supported

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,579
anyone in stealing business secrets for

11
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,739
a long time the relevant US departments

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,899
have been conducting organized and

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,879
large-scale cyber espionage and

14
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,189
surveillance on a lot of individuals and

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,359
organizations it has been an OD secret

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,229
and it doesn't end there

17
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,628
Rachel Blevins breaks it all down for us

18
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:44,128
the tit for tat battle between the

19
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,439
United States and China continues to

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,079
escalate and now China is accusing the

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,659
u.s. of fabricating facts in its cyber

22
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:54,780
hacking claims these latest accusations

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,479
come after the u.s. charged two Chinese

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,549
nationals with stealing trade secrets

25
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,149
from American government agencies

26
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,859
according to an unsealed indictment the

27
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:07,140
two alleged hackers were able to breach

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,469
computers of more than 45 entities in a

29
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,859
variety of industries including aviation

30
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:16,469
space and pharmaceutical technology all

31
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,530
on behalf of the Chinese military the

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,329
Department of Justice claims that the

33
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,239
suspects were part of a group called apt

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,450
10 that had dozens of computers in at

35
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,810
least a dozen countries the charges

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,090
include conspiracy to commit computer

37
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,978
intrusions against dozens of companies

38
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:37,950
in the United States and around the

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,989
world

40
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,328
the DOJ went on to accuse the group of

41
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,640
quote outright cheating and theft and

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
claim that it's alleged actions gave

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,379
China and unfair advantage at the

44
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,049
expense of law-abiding businesses and

45
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,810
countries but China is claiming that the

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,368
United States is the one that is

47
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,890
responsible for cyber espionage a

48
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,930
spokesperson for the country's Ministry

49
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,120
of Foreign Affairs demanded in a

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Media tend to what she called fabricated

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,719
facts maybe well the u.s. is the biggest

52
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,389
power in the world but it is arrogant

53
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,460
and selfish and plays hard to suppress

54
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,409
the legitimate development rights of

55
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,300
other countries out of its own pursuit

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,819
of hegemony and Merrill mind it even

57
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,270
fabricated maxim this does not match his

58
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,969
status as a big powers this kind of us

59
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:29,060
is not good for peace and development

60
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,650
well it does not appear that the two

61
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,840
individuals named in the indictment have

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
been taken into custody the United

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,620
States claimed that more than a dozen

64
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,780
countries were affected by the alleged

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,139
hack could have a major impact now the

66
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,539
UK has joined with the US and has

67
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,789
publicly claimed that this campaign is

68
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:49,919
one of the most significant and

69
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,740
widespread cyber intrusions against the

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,229
UK and its allies that has been

71
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,750
uncovered to date with the intent to

72
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,659
target trade secrets and economic

73
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,419
interest around the world so while a

74
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,060
range of claims have been made by both

75
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,550
sides in this conflict it still remains

76
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,379
to be seen whether the countries

77
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,349
involved will actively retaliate and if

78
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,090
any evidence of the alleged cyber

79
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,659
hacking claims will be made public in

80
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:22,709
Washington Rachel Blevins RT and joining

81
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,479
me now to discuss investigative

82
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,810
journalist Ben Swan hey there Ben so

83
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,370
things appeared to be easing up though

84
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,439
between the US and China trade talks

85
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,530
were back underway and then BAM the u.s.

86
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,259
calls Canada to arrest the the Huawei

87
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,039
CFO and now this so what do you make of

88
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,099
the current us-china relations well I

89
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,139
think that as you said you know it

90
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,550
seemed like things were kind of on track

91
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,599
and things were going well

92
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,400
and then all of a sudden we ended up in

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,689
this situation that where it becomes

94
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,819
very messy obviously the arrests of the

95
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,310
CFO was a very big deal China's very

96
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,199
upset about it it's having big

97
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,330
ramifications for Canada as well but I

98
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,469
think the other thing that's taking

99
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,169
place here is that we know there's this

100
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,090
back and forth over tariffs right now on

101
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,650
and I wonder how much of that is playing

102
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,539
into this which side is going to get the

103
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:12,030
upper hand in terms of trade tariffs and

104
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,620
and how that plays out and how much of

105
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,479
what's going on right now is kind of a

106
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,329
falling over that backdrop and let's

107
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,310
let's talk about cybersecurity I know

108
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,108
that's really in your wheelhouse they're

109
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,290
experts all over the country say that

110
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,500
China has been on a global tear in the

111
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,720
way of cyber espionage ever since at

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,269
least 2014 and believe that it's China

113
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,189
that's really America's number one

114
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:38,339
threat in this new century do you agree

115
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,810
with that sentiment so cyber security is

116
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,209
a very big deal and is China the biggest

117
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,279
threat maybe I think there's a you could

118
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,110
make a very strong case for the idea

119
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,850
that China is here's the problem is that

120
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,910
everyone's hands are so dirty when it

121
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,459
comes to cyber security the u.s. is in

122
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,189
such a mess of its own obviously you go

123
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,439
back into 2014 in Edward Snowden and all

124
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,550
the stuff that came out about what the

125
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,439
NSA had been doing in the US government

126
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,668
have been doing spying on foreign

127
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:07,978
leaders hacking emails of Americans and

128
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:09,990
people internationally but there's a lot

129
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,579
of issues here but that doesn't mean

130
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,740
that China is it's okay for trying to do

131
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,449
whatever they're doing it's just that

132
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,209
everyone is such a dirty player in this

133
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,038
space and so many of these governments

134
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:21,538
are that it's hard to say well this is

135
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,069
the biggest threat this one's the most

136
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:25,319
dangerous because we're all doing it all

137
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,939
these nations are doing it to each other

138
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:28,800
if everyone would stop maybe we could

139
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,089
figure out what the bad players are but

140
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,350
no one wants to stop they just want to

141
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,538
say well we're not as bad as they are or

142
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:34,829
we have to do it because they're doing

143
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:38,100
it true but now another flash point in

144
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,009
us-china relations is is over the South

145
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,829
China Sea the Chinese continue to build

146
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,410
up their naval fleet there the US and

147
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,990
its allies find this to be some sort of

148
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,990
threat first why is this a threat to the

149
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,478
US and what do you view would be a fair

150
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,149
response to counter China's actions

151
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,779
there well look as someone who believes

152
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,970
the US needs to be involved in far fewer

153
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,189
interventions around the world you know

154
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:08,250
we know that the u.s. loves to flex its

155
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,750
military muscle we spend so much money

156
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,120
on military so everything you know we s

157
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,139
when you're a hammer everything looks

158
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,910
like a nail right and so that's how they

159
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,740
you as a military sees everything and

160
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,939
yet you know you look at what's

161
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,620
happening in the South China Sea how

162
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,259
does that really affect the US and u.s.

163
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,120
sovereignty and the security of the

164
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,848
United States it's not like China is

165
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:27,408
building up

166
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:30,319
fleets on the coast of Maine now doing

167
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,449
this in the Gulf of Mexico right and so

168
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,459
I think that's one of the the problems

169
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,348
with the with the narrative that every

170
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:37,908
time any government does anything

171
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,610
military wise the US has to respond in

172
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,769
some military way to continue to be what

173
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,538
policeman of the world to flex its

174
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,069
military might I just I don't think that

175
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:48,079
it's necessary for the u.s. to respond

176
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,999
every time another government in its own

177
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,978
corner of the world does something now

178
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,829
last Ben I want you to listen to what

179
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:55,928
the Chinese foreign ministry

180
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:58,639
spokesperson had to say and I want to

181
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,949
get your response on the other side we

182
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:02,988
urged the u.s. to immediately correct

183
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:06,168
its wrong actions stop slandering and

184
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,028
blackening China on the cybersecurity

185
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,968
issue and withdraw the so called

186
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:14,178
indictment of Chinese citizens so as to

187
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:16,639
avoid serious damage to china-us

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,759
relations in bilateral cooperation and

189
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,848
relevant fields is that fair is the US

190
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:26,238
making an example of these guys I think

191
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,738
the u.s. is trying to make an example of

192
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,300
them and you know when you consider that

193
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,139
that the arrest of the CFO right is that

194
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,598
would be the equivalency of someone like

195
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,269
a Tim Cook from Apple being arrested in

196
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,189
Beijing and the Chinese government

197
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,990
holding them if that were to happen the

198
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,658
US would for lack of a better term flip

199
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:48,860
its wig right nuts if that were to

200
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,439
happen to a prominent CEO or CFO of a

201
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,619
major US tech company and yet - for the

202
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,899
u.s. to be involved in this the US and

203
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,178
Canada - to have the CFO arrested and

204
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,278
want her in sent to the United States

205
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:03,738
and and AW extradite is the word I'm

206
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:04,728
looking for all these things that are

207
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:06,439
taking place yeah I think that it's

208
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,329
reasonable that China is upset about

209
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,550
this for for people who look at that and

210
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,499
say well I you know why is China so

211
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,569
upset just imagine if the shoe were on

212
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,129
the other foot and the analyst would see

213
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,559
it as an attack on US Authority u.s.

214
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,778
sovereignty you know as being the

215
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:21,800
biggest player in the world so I

216
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,598
understand why the Chinese are about it

217
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:25,069
again I think a lot of it just comes

218
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,829
back to everyone's hands so dirty on so

219
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:29,209
many of these levels all right we gotta

220
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,559
leave it right there thanks so much for
